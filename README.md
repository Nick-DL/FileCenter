 A place to transfer files in MZ

---

For anyone who suddenly visit these files

Maybe at this time I've guaduated from MYZX, so that's really a pity...

Putting these files here makes me easy to get them from almost every computer in MZ without using a usb disk.

If these files take up too much space, you could delete them, but I'll be sad *_*

I'm now in Grade Senior.Due to loss of input method software, I have to write in English.
